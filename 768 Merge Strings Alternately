1768. Merge Strings Alternately
You are given two strings word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.
Return the merged string.
Constraints:
1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 100
word1 and word2 consist of lowercase English letters.

Code: 
class Solution {
    public String mergeAlternately(String word1, String word2) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        int n1 = word1.length();
        int n2 = word2.length();
        int i=0;
        while(i<n1 || i<n2){
            if(i<n1)
                sb.append(word1.charAt(i));
                if(i<n2)
                    sb.append(word2.charAt(i));
                    i++;
    
                }
                return sb.toString();
    }
}
